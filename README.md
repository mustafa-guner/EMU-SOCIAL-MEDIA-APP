<h1 aling="center"> Introduction </h1>
<p>Today, using social media has become very popular in society and is also used in 
higher education. many social media platforms are used for communication and universities 
have also used their own media application similar to these social media platforms, and it 
has become a very important place to increase communication. The project given to us aims 
to provide and facilitate communication between students, staff, and faculty members. A 
social media application made for the IT department of our university. The purpose of the 
application is to provide information sharing between students, school staff, and academic 
staff, these are announcements, contact information, time sheets, etc. In addition, while 
the application allows users to communicate with each other, it will also allow students to 
receive information about the dates of upcoming meetings and events.
Apart from this, it will provide the opportunity to create clubs and groups for the 
communities within the IT department in practice, so that they will have a chance to join 
and become a member through non-application. At the same time, they will be able to 
access the menu of the cafeteria through the application and be aware of what is happening 
daily from there. Thanks to the application, safe and fast communication will be ensured 
between the faculty members and students in the school department, and at the same time, 
the activities will be informed by the clubs and groups.
Also, by sharing the job opportunities directed to us by our faculty members here, we will 
be able to provide faster access and thus we will be informed about the job opportunities. 
In addition, there will be fast communication and a smooth connection environment in case 
of emergency or aid campaigns.
The application will be a free and efficient tool for the IT department to communicate 
information and resources and for students to access information.

<h1 aling="center"> Development Methodology </h1>
<h2> Programming Languages</h2>
<p>In our project we use JavaScript for frontend and backend develop, for our base level
application (for gateway) we use PHP (Laravel), on the database side we use NoSQL and
MongoDB. Some of our backend functions written in C# .net but in the middle of the development 
process our team have decided to switch our code base form .net to NodeJS because of some scalability. </p>
<h2> System Architecture and Processing Methods </h2>
<p>In our project we use scrum architecture and methodology </p>
<h2> Database Management Systems</h2>
<p> NoSQL and MongoDB (mongo atlas and aws cloud)
since we have complicated data structure for our web app, we decided to use no relational SQL
collections because we have 2 type of users such as stuff and students
and they have their own models and NoSQL makes it easier to process our data.</p>
<h2> Hardware and Communication Platform</h2>
<p> For the hardware we use our personal computers to develop our project, for
communication some weeks we make some meetings at the school but mostly we use discord
for online meetings. </p>
